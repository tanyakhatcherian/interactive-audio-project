Hello. 
This is my README file. I've decided to go with an interactive website that is called SafeSpace. It's a simple website that provides 3 audio tracks for the user to click through. Each track is intended to have a calming effect. I wanted the backgrounds to change onclick to match the audio, and I wanted there to be a fade-in transition between background images. Originally, I would have liked to curate a playlist similar in UI of my favourite songs, but my favourite songs are not royalty free music lol. So I opted for this instead, going with sounds that were free. 

Shoutout @Rocco for helping me with the animation because apparently you can't easily animate background images.
